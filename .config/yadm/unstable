# Patterns of paths to unstable files for the dotfiles repository.
# A file is considered unstable if it can change in a way that does not affect
# its semantic meaning, e.g. if the order of XML attributes changes but not the values.
#
# NOTE: These files will be marked with the assume-unchanged bit in the git index,
# meaning that any interesting change might be unnoticed. Use with caution.
